## What is Multi-Book Renderer?

Multi-Book Renderer (MBR) is a markdown-based book hosting platform that allows you to:

1. **Create** books using simple markdown files
2. **Organize** chapters with automatic navigation
3. **Read** books with a beautiful, responsive interface
4. **Execute** code examples interactively
5. **Version Control** with automatic Git integration

## Getting Started

This sample book will guide you through all the features of MBR. Each chapter builds on the previous one, so we recommend reading them in order.

### Navigation

Use the sidebar on the left to jump between chapters, or use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons at the top and bottom of each page.

## What's Next?

In the next chapter, we'll explore the markdown basics and see how MBR enhances standard markdown with additional features.
