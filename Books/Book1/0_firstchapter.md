# This is my first chapter of Book1.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

Welcome to the first chapter of Book1. In this chapter, we will explore the basics of our book rendering system.
This system is designed to render markdown files, support LaTeX for mathematical expressions, and display diagrams using Mermaid syntax.

### Key Features
- **Markdown Rendering**: The system can render markdown files, allowing for rich text formatting.
- **Mathematical Expressions**: LaTeX support enables the inclusion of complex mathematical formulas.
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid syntax allows for the creation of flowcharts and other diagrams directly within the markdown.

### Getting Started

To get started, ensure you have the necessary tools installed:
1. **Markdown Editor**: Use any markdown editor to create and edit your chapters.
2. **LaTeX Support**: Ensure you have a LaTeX renderer for mathematical expressions.
3. **Mermaid Support**: Install Mermaid for diagram rendering.

### Example Markdown
Here is a simple example of markdown syntax:

```markdown
# This is a heading
## This is a subheading
```

```csharp
This is a code block
```

It should also support LaTeX for mathematical expressions like this:
$$
E = mc^2
$$

### Example Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Is it working?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Great!];
    B -- No --> D[Debug];
    D --> B;
```
