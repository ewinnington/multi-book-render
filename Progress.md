# Multi-Book Render Development Progress

## Project Status: Core Infrastructure Setup
**Date Started:** May 25, 2025

## Completed Work Session 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure
- [x] Task 1.1: Project Setup and Dependencies
  - [x] Add required NuGet packages (Markdig, LibGit2Sharp)
  - [x] Configure project structure and namespaces
  - [x] Created solution with 3 projects: Web, Core, Services
- [x] Task 1.2: File System Architecture Design - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
  - [x] Created core domain models (Book, Chapter, User, AppSettings)
  - [x] Designed folder structure for books and chapters
  - [x] Created service interfaces
  - [ ] Create default Data folder structure
- [ ] Task 1.3: Configuration and Settings Management
  - [ ] Implement settings service
  - [ ] Set up environment-specific configurations

## COMPLETED Work Session 1: Core Infrastructure and Basic Functionality
- [x] Task 1.1: Project Setup and Dependencies ✅
  - [x] Created solution with 3 projects: BookRenderer.Web, BookRenderer.Core, BookRenderer.Services
  - [x] Added required NuGet packages (Markdig, LibGit2Sharp)
  - [x] Set up dependency injection in Program.cs
- [x] Task 1.2: File System Architecture Design ✅
  - [x] Created core domain models (Book, Chapter, User, AppSettings)
  - [x] Created service interfaces (IBookService, IChapterService, IMarkdownService, etc.)
  - [x] Created sample book structure in Data/Books/sample-book/
- [x] Task 1.3: Service Implementations ✅
  - [x] FileSystemService - file I/O operations
  - [x] GitService - Git repository management
  - [x] MarkdownService - markdown processing with Markdig
  - [x] BookService - book CRUD operations
  - [x] ChapterService - chapter management
- [x] Phase 3.1: Basic UI Implementation ✅
  - [x] HomeController - book listing
  - [x] BookController - book reading interface
  - [x] ChapterController (API) - chapter content delivery
  - [x] Basic views: Layout, Home/Index, Book/Read
  - [x] Bootstrap styling and responsive design
  - [x] Created sample book with 3 chapters

## CURRENT STATUS: Testing & Validation Phase
**Working on:** Ensuring the application starts and basic functionality works

### Completed Implementation (Ready for Testing):
- [x] **Project Structure**: 3-project solution with proper references
- [x] **Core Models**: Book, Chapter, User, AppSettings with relationships
- [x] **Service Layer**: 5 services (FileSystem, Git, Markdown, Book, Chapter) with interfaces
- [x] **Dependency Injection**: All services registered in Program.cs
- [x] **MVC Controllers**: Home (book listing), Book (reading), Chapter (API)
- [x] **UI Components**: Responsive layout with Bootstrap 5, book grid, reading interface
- [x] **Markdown Pipeline**: Markdig with extensions for advanced features
- [x] **Sample Content**: Complete sample book with 3 chapters demonstrating features
- [x] **Static Assets**: CSS styling, JavaScript for interactions
- [x] **External Libraries**: CDN integration for KaTeX, Prism.js, Mermaid

### File Structure Created:
```
src/
├── BookRenderer.sln
├── BookRenderer.Core/           # Domain models and interfaces
├── BookRenderer.Services/       # Business logic implementations
├── BookRenderer.Web/           # ASP.NET MVC application
└── Data/Books/sample-book/     # Sample book content
```

### What Needs Testing:
- [ ] **Application Startup**: Verify app compiles and starts without errors
- [ ] **Book Discovery**: Confirm books are loaded from Data/Books/ folder
- [ ] **Home Page**: Book listing displays correctly with covers and metadata
- [ ] **Book Reading**: Chapter navigation and markdown rendering works
- [ ] **API Endpoints**: Chapter content delivery via ChapterController
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: UI works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] **External Libraries**: KaTeX math, Prism.js syntax highlighting, Mermaid diagrams

### Next Steps After Testing:
- [ ] **Math Rendering**: Validate KaTeX integration for LaTeX expressions
- [ ] **Code Execution**: Implement executable code blocks framework
- [ ] **Git Integration**: Initialize Git repositories for books
- [ ] **User Authentication**: Add login/user management system
- [ ] **Admin Interface**: Book management and editing capabilities
- [ ] **Advanced Features**: Search, bookmarks, notes, export options

### Known Potential Issues:
- File path resolution between different projects
- Markdown rendering configuration
- Static file serving for book assets
- CSS/JS CDN dependencies loading
