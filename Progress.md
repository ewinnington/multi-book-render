# Multi-Book Render Development Progress

## CURRENT ISSUES TO RESOLVE - May 25, 2025 ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Priority Issue Resolution Required:

**1. Image Path Compatibility Issue** üñºÔ∏è
- **Problem**: External markdown editors use `assets/image.png` format, but current image processing expects direct names
- **Current State**: Images work with direct names (`image.png`) but fail with `assets/` prefix  
- **Required**: Support both formats without duplication when serving from `/api/books/{bookId}/assets/{imagePath}`
- **Files to Fix**: `MarkdownService.ProcessImagePaths()` method

**2. Asset Management System Missing** üìÅ
- **Problem**: No UI/API for managing book assets (upload, view, delete)
- **Required**: Complete asset management interface for each book
- **Implementation Needed**: 
  - Asset upload endpoint and UI
  - Asset browsing/listing interface  
  - Asset deletion functionality
  - Integration with chapter editor

**3. Chapter Title Persistence Bug** ‚ùå
- **Problem**: Chapter titles from form input still not persisting despite ChapterService updates
- **Root Cause**: Frontend may be loading from cached data or form binding issue
- **Status**: ChapterService now updates book.json but issue persists
- **Investigation Needed**: Form processing pipeline, model binding, frontend data loading

**4. User Access Control Not Implemented** üîí
- **Problem**: Private books with specific user access not working
- **Current State**: Books can be marked private but user assignment missing
- **Required**: UI and logic for assigning specific users to private books

## CURRENT SESSION: Issue Resolution - May 25, 2025

### Issues to Address:

1. **üñºÔ∏è Image Asset Path Compatibility**
   - **Problem**: External markdown editors use `assets/image.png` paths, but our serving logic expects direct names
   - **Impact**: Images don't display when editing files externally
   - **Solution Needed**: Update MarkdownService to handle both `image.png` and `assets/image.png` paths without duplication

2. **üìÅ Asset Management System**
   - **Problem**: No UI for uploading, viewing, or deleting book assets
   - **Impact**: Users can't manage images and files for their books
   - **Solution Needed**: Create asset management interface with upload/delete functionality

3. **üìù Chapter Title Persistence Issue - DIAGNOSED**
   - **Root Cause Found**: BookService.LoadChaptersAsync scans filesystem AND book.json chapters are added separately, creating duplicates
   - **Evidence**: Debug logs show two entries for same chapter (e.g., "06-fmv" from filesystem + "fmv" from metadata)
   - **Impact**: Filesystem scan overrides book.json metadata, losing custom titles
   - **Solution Path**: Modify BookService to use ONLY book.json metadata for chapters, not filesystem scanning

4. **üë• User Access Control for Private Books**
   - **Problem**: `allowedUsers` field exists but no UI to assign users to private books
   - **Impact**: Private books can't be shared with specific users
   - **Solution Needed**: Add user assignment interface for private books

### Implementation Plan:

#### Phase 1: Fix Chapter Title Persistence (HIGH PRIORITY)
```
1. Modify BookService.LoadBookFromDirectoryAsync to NOT call LoadChaptersAsync if book.json has chapters
2. Ensure ChapterService metadata updates are the single source of truth
3. Test chapter creation/editing to verify titles persist
```

#### Phase 2: Image Asset Path Compatibility
```
1. Update MarkdownService.ProcessImagePaths to handle "assets/" prefixed paths
2. Avoid double-processing when path already starts with "assets/"
3. Test with external markdown editors
```

#### Phase 3: Asset Management System
```
1. Create AssetsController for upload/delete operations
2. Add asset management UI to book management pages
3. Implement file upload with validation
4. Add asset browser/gallery view
```

#### Phase 4: User Access Control
```
1. Add user selection UI for private books
2. Update book editing interface
3. Implement access control checks
```
